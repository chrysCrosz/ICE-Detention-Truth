<h1>The Private Prison Rebrand: How Wackenhut and CCA Became Billion-Dollar Deportation Machines</h1>

<p><em>How two scandal-plagued companies rebranded, secured no-bid government contracts, and turned immigrant detention into a multi-billion dollar industry</em></p>

<h2>Remember These Names: Wackenhut and CCA</h2>

<p>If you lived in Oklahoma—or anywhere in America during the 1990s—you might remember <strong>Wackenhut Corrections</strong> and <strong>Corrections Corporation of America (CCA)</strong>. These were the private prison companies that nearly went bankrupt after widespread scandals involving violence, sexual abuse, escapes, and deplorable conditions.</p>

<p>Wackenhut's original parent company had spent decades building dossiers on civil rights demonstrators and anti-war protesters—anyone founder George Wackenhut considered a "communist sympathizer" or "derogatory type."</p>

<p>Both companies faced hundreds of lawsuits. Both were on the brink of collapse. So they did what any failing corporation does: <strong>they rebranded</strong>.</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>The Rebrand Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wackenhut Corrections → GEO Group (2004)</strong> - <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2004/jun/15/wackenhut-changes-name-to-geo-group-politics-remain-the-same/" target="_blank">Prison Legal News headline: "Wackenhut Changes Name to Geo Group, Politics Remain the Same"</a></li>
<li><strong>Corrections Corporation of America → CoreCivic (2016)</strong> - <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/10/28/cca-changes-name-amid-ongoing-scrutiny/92883274/" target="_blank">Rebranded just two months after Obama's DOJ announced it would phase out private prisons</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>When you see "CoreCivic" or "GEO Group" today, remember: <strong>that's Wackenhut and CCA in a new suit</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Numbers: From Near-Bankruptcy to Billion-Dollar Quarters</h2>

<p>Now they make more in a single quarter than they made in entire years before the rebrand.</p>

<h3>Original Growth (1986-1994)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CCA:</strong> $14 million (1986) → $120 million (1994) = 757% growth</li>
<li><strong>Wackenhut:</strong> $19 million (1989) → $84 million (1994) = 342% growth</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post-Rebrand Revenue (Q3 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CoreCivic:</strong> $580.4 million in 3 months</li>
<li><strong>GEO Group:</strong> $682.3 million in 3 months</li>
<li><strong>Combined:</strong> $1.26 BILLION in a single quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>That's more than GEO Group's entire annual revenue in 2006.</p>

<h2>No-Bid Contracts: $45 Billion in Taxpayer Funds</h2>

<p>Since Trump's January 2025 inauguration, both companies received <strong>9 no-bid contracts worth billions</strong>—bypassing competitive bidding by claiming "compelling urgency."</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CoreCivic's Leavenworth deal: $4.2 million per month</li>
<li>GEO Group Georgia facility: $66 million annually</li>
<li>Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" allocated <strong>$45 billion</strong> specifically for ICE to pay private contractors</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>These are the same companies that <strong>couldn't maintain basic standards at existing facilities</strong>, yet they're getting taxpayer money to expand.</p>

<h2>What's Happening Inside These Facilities</h2>

<h3>Medical Neglect & Preventable Deaths</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/06/2024-07-01-ICE-Detainee-Deaths.pdf" target="_blank">ACLU study of ICE detainee deaths (2017-2021)</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>95% of 52 reviewed deaths were preventable</strong> with appropriate medical care</li>
<li>88% involved incorrect or incomplete diagnoses by detention medical staff</li>
<li>79% had incomplete, inappropriate, or delayed treatment</li>
<li>40% of facilities failed to provide timely emergency care or operable equipment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sexual Abuse, Violence & Corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GEO Group's Folkston facility:</strong> 2022 complaints documented severe physical violence, retaliatory solitary confinement, and "extraction teams" attacking detained individuals</li>
<li><strong>CoreCivic's Mesa Verde facility:</strong> 2025 lawsuit alleged insect infestations, sewage problems, denial of water, food, and legal access</li>
<li><strong>Federal Bureau of Prisons FCI Dublin:</strong> December 2024 settlement of $115.8 million to 103 survivors of systematic sexual abuse by staff. Staff called it "The Rape Club"</li>
<li><strong>Drug trafficking and extortion:</strong> Documented cases of guards involved in selling contraband and extorting detainees</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Cesar Reyes Case: This Could Be Anyone</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.kosu.org/show/this-week-in-oklahoma-politics/2025-07-11/how-federal-immigration-policy-led-to-the-deportation-of-an-advisor-to-oklahomas-governor" target="_blank">Cesar Reyes</a>, 29 years old, brought to Oklahoma as a teenager:</p>

<ul>
<li>Worked his way to becoming a hotel manager</li>
<li>Served on Governor Kevin Stitt's Hispanic Advisory Council</li>
<li>Paid taxes every year</li>
<li>Had an immigration attorney working his case</li>
<li>Had no criminal record</li>
</ul>

<p>In February 2025, he showed up to a <strong>routine check-in with ICE</strong> as instructed—the same kind of check-in he'd been doing every three months for over a decade. He brought his 3-year-old U.S.-born son with him.</p>

<p>An ICE officer simply told him in Spanish: <em>"Es tiempo de regresar a Guatemala"</em> (It's time to return to Guatemala). No warning. No sympathy.</p>

<p>Over two weeks, he was transported through federal detention centers—including GEO Group facilities—where guards ate hot biscuits in front of handcuffed prisoners while serving them cold sandwiches they couldn't eat with their hands still restrained. His family's breadwinner was gone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I was doing everything the right way. I feel like I was let down by the system, by the country that I call home. I thought America was freedom."<br>—Cesar Reyes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what CoreCivic and GEO Group are making billions on.</p>

<h2>The Tax Betrayal: The System You Can't Win</h2>

<p>Millions of undocumented immigrants filed taxes using an ITIN—an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number—to <strong>comply with federal law</strong>. That required providing personal information under penalty of perjury.</p>

<h3>What They Paid:</h3>
<ul>
<li>$96.7 billion in taxes in 2022</li>
<li>Nearly $100 billion in 2024 (with extensions still being processed)</li>
<li>$25.7 billion to Social Security</li>
<li>$6.4 billion to Medicare</li>
<li><strong>Programs they cannot access</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/" target="_blank">Source: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy</a></p>

<h3>Then the Government Weaponized It</h3>

<p>In <strong>April 2025</strong>, the IRS and ICE signed a data-sharing agreement.</p>

<p>By <strong>August 2025</strong>, ICE had requested information on <strong>1.28 million taxpayers</strong> from the IRS—including home addresses from tax records.</p>

<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-share-tax-records-ice-dhs-deportations" target="_blank">According to ProPublica's investigation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IRS is building an <strong>automated system</strong> for "on-demand" bulk data sharing</li>
<li>ICE can submit spreadsheets with names and get back enriched data with current addresses</li>
<li>Designed to enable ICE to deport <strong>3,000 people per day</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>People provided personal information under penalty of perjury to comply with U.S. tax law. That exact information is now being weaponized to find and arrest them.</strong></p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Who would've ever thought that compliance would get them arrested?</strong></p>
<p>This country calls itself free—but honestly, for who?</p>
</div>

<h2>December 2025: The $121 Million Skip Tracing Contract</h2>

<p>On December 16th, 2025, GEO Group (formerly Wackenhut) was awarded a <a href="https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36740797/the-geo-group-awarded-contract-by-u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-for-provi" target="_blank">$121 million no-bid contract with ICE for "skip tracing services"</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Skip tracing means:</strong> Finding people using identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation.</p>

<p>They're literally getting paid $121 million to hunt down individuals on ICE's "non-detained docket"—people who filed taxes, people trying to live their lives.</p>

<h2>The Money Exists—It's Just Not for You</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, there's "no money" to extend ACA subsidies. No money for healthcare. No money to help people afford to live.</p>

<p>But there's:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$45 billion</strong> for ICE detention and deportation</li>
<li><strong>$121 million</strong> just to hunt people down</li>
<li><strong>$580 million</strong> in a single quarter for CoreCivic</li>
<li><strong>$682 million</strong> in a single quarter for GEO Group</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The money exists. It's just being spent on detention, deportation, and profit instead of people.</strong></p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The private prison companies made it clear: <strong>they profit when detention increases, regardless of guilt or innocence</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>65-75% of their contracts include <strong>minimum occupancy clauses</strong> guaranteeing payment if facilities aren't full</li>
<li>They lobbied for policies that maximize incarceration through organizations like ALEC (formed 1973)</li>
<li>They rebranded to hide documented histories of violence, sexual abuse, and corruption</li>
<li>They receive no-bid contracts worth billions</li>
</ul>

<p>People aren't detained because they're criminals. They're detained because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can be detained profitably</li>
<li>The system has been rebranded to hide its abusive past</li>
<li>Taxpayers are paying $14 billion annually for ICE detention</li>
<li>Private companies get $45 billion in appropriations</li>
<li>Their own tax compliance has been weaponized against them</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>The real criminals—the ones making billions, sexually abusing detainees, starving people, denying medical care—get government protection and contracts.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>Share This</h2>

<p>The truth needs to get out there. People need to know that Wackenhut and CCA didn't go away—they just changed their names. They need to know that their tax information is being weaponized. They need to know where the money is really going.</p>

<p><strong>Share this. Tell people what's really happening.</strong></p>
